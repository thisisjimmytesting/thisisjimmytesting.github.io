					Need to write different inttro Taking its title from philosopher Édouard Glissant’s question, ‘What If Carthage Hadn’t Been Destroyed?’ – Nidhal Chamekh’s, ‘Et si Carthage’, is inspired by the ancient city whose ruins are a ten-minute drive from Selma Feriani’s gallery space in downtown Tunis. By speculating on what might have happened if Carthage hadn’t been razed, Glissant offers a thought experiment in which the Punic people acted as a counterpoint to an empire that would go on to form the basis of Western civilization.

						What might Carthage  represent today, this legendary city founded by the
						Phoenicians and razed to  the ground by the Romans to impose their reign on
						North Africa and eliminate  the competing worldview that it embodied? The
						writer and theoretician Édouard  Glissant dreamt of Carthage as a city of
						crossroads and encounters, rich in  different cultures, an early site of
						‘creolisation’ where this bringing  together of diverse elements could
						create new cultural possibilities, greater  than any sum of the parts. The
						first section of <em>Le sel noir</em> (1956) is dedicated to the
						cosmopolitan metropolis, and  – like many others before and since – he
						wondered speculatively in a paper  entitled ‘Et si Carthage…?’: ‘What if
						Carthage had not been destroyed?’ What  kind of space could the
						Mediterranean have become if Carthage had continued to  exist as a
						generative force in counterbalance to Rome?
					</p>
					<p>
						Nidhal Chamekh takes  Glissant's question and turns it on its head,
						affirming the latent power of the  multiverse of paths untold and suppressed
						in the histories of the ‘victors’ and  the ‘vanquished’, of triumphs and
						sackings. His sculptural assemblage
						<strong>
							Masque noir, tête de Niobides
						</strong>
						(2023)  literally figures the merging of African and Greco-Roman cultures
						and the  compression of cultural difference. In Chamekh’s research
						underlying this body  of work, he was interested in making visible the
						ancient influences of North  Africa on Roman antiquity. Figures such as the
						horned deity Ammon draw together  Berber, Phoenician, Egyptian and Roman
						gods. Carthage was crushed by Rome, yet  subsequently the province of Africa
						Romana became very important in Roman  trade, culture and indeed politics,
						notably through the African Emperor  Septimius Severus and his dynasty.
						Roman rule worked to integrate the best of  what was found in the provinces;
						Chamekh underlines how Carthage itself  persists in Rome and elsewhere
						through a plethora of cultural and iconographic  influences.

						Chamekh  reminds us that the resilience of the Punic metropolis, of which it
						is said  that the very earth was salted by the Roman troops so that it might
						never rise  again, can also be read in the eyes of the vanquished and
						exiled. Today it can  be seen in the determination of all those who, in
						crossing the Mediterranean,  rebel against the structural mechanisms of the
						globalised economy, developed  across long periods of imperial domination
						and colonial extraction to  concentrate wealth in the hands of the northern
						few. Chamekh’s <strong>Ismaël</strong> and <strong>Legs with helmet</strong>
						(both from 2023) place plaster-cast sections of  bodies into relationship
						with forms of restraint and violence. This second line  of research into
						exile and the displacement of African communities runs through  the
						exhibition in parallel to the reflection on Carthage and Rome. The
						sculpture <strong>X (</strong>2023) that welcomes  visitors on the first
						wall of the show presents a copy modelled in clay of an  ancient Punic
						mask-like funerary object (in the collection of the Bardo Museum  in Tunis),
						clad in a ‘hoodie’, a piece of clothing that can be drawn down to  shield
						the face from harsh weather or recognition. A tribute to David Hammons’  ‘In
						the Hood’ (1993), the work draws together the structural racism and
						policing experienced by black men in the Unites States with that experienced
						by  exiles from the African continent in Europe. The Punic face forms a
						disturbing  smile under the hoodie, speaking to movements of people across
						the millennia.  Hidden in Hammons there is also the god Ammon.

						The culmination of a  major project that has been at the heart of his
						artistic activity for several  years, including during his period as a
						resident at the Villa Medici in Rome  (2021-2022), Chamekh’s body of work is
						informed by detailed iconographic  research. The constellations of images
						this generates are fundamental to his  process of juxtaposing, reworking and
						reassembling fragments. <strong>‘And what if Carthage…’</strong>brings
						together  an articulated series of works including large-format drawings on
						structures  made of scaffolding-like elements; sculptures formed from
						plaster casts of  objects, bodies and other sculptures, assembled with found
						objects (from  musical instruments to masks); transfers on fabric and on
						paper; and a rich  archive of research materials from books, film and music
						to an extensive  wall-based cartography of concepts and images — forming
						together a  heterogeneous ensemble in which the fragment and the marginal
						detail are  important.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the words of the  artist speaking of his process of artistic research and
						assemblage:
					</p>
					<p>
						‘The elements retain  traces of their original worlds and cannot be
						assimilated into a visual  totality. It's a practice of montage that
						introduces the multiple, the diverse  and the hybrid. The images confront,
						connect and repel each other.’
					</p>
					<p>
						Filling out his  fields of research straddling Mediterranean antiquity to
						contemporary crossings  and exile, is Chamekh’s consideration of how
						modernity viewed antiquity in the  nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when
						colonial ideology had a profound  effect on the writing of the ancient
						history of Northern Africa and Southern  Europe. The affirmation of the
						Roman presence through interpretations of  archaeological traces,
						underlining its extent and the pervasiveness of its  influence, contributed
						to justifying the French presence and methods in the  territories they
						occupied, and later also the Italian colonial presence. Both  positioned
						themselves as heirs to the Romans, legitimately unfolding their
						predestination to empire and claiming their rights around the shores of <em>
						Mare Nostrum</em>, as can be clearly read in  Carmine Gallone’s film of the
						fascist period in Italy <em>Scipione l'Africano</em> (1937). In the
						sculpture <strong>Calchi facciale</strong> (2023), Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a
						key actor in the  establishment of the <em>Code noir</em> which  defined
						conditions of slavery in the French colonial empire, bears an
						anthropological facial cast. Chamekh here references the justifications for
						colonial expropriation laid out through the invention of ‘racial sciences’
						in  Europe, running in parallel to the affirmation of a genealogy traced to
						Greek  and Roman antiquity in the development of European Humanism —which
						cloaked  under its ideology of universalism the reality of the exclusion of
						most of  humanity from its protections and rights. In his first large
						drawing from the  series <strong><em>et si Carthage?</em></strong> (2023),
						Chamekh brings together fragments of  images and text evoking the long
						history of the looting of obelisks and other  sculptures from North Africa
						for the glorification of European regimes and the  naturalisation of their
						imperial power. He gives particular attention to the  1935 Italian theft of
						an important historical stele from Axum in Ethiopia that  was shipped to
						Naples in pieces before being reassembled and erected in Porta  Capena
						Square in Rome in front of the Ministry of Italian Africa. Ethiopian
						demands for restitution of the Axum stele continued for over half a century
						before this important piece of cultural heritage was returned and
						reinstalled.
					</p>
					<p>
						Faced with these  histories, Chamekh seeks to translate, in his assemblages
						of heterogeneous  elements, the dissonances, discontinuities and
						hybridisations that they  contain. He is interested in how images, whether
						historical or current, are not  static, but are rather constantly redefining
						and redeploying themselves across  visual culture, literature, the natural
						and human sciences and other fields.  While generally this redeployment acts
						to underpin and reinforce existing  historical and political tropes, there
						is also a potential for this montage  process to contribute to rethinking
						and reactivating the past in the present.  One of the counter histories that
						Chamekh bring to the fore in the exhibition  is that of Mezwed music as a
						form of marginalised cultural production that has  been linked to exile in
						the songs of its leading exponents such as Hedi Guella,  whose 1984 album
						<em>Périples</em>, features  the compositions ‘Carte d’identité’, ‘Pays
						chagrin’ and ‘Le bateau de  l’immigration’. Chamekh also points to its
						discovery by black jazz musicians  including Don Cherry whose encounters
						with Mezwed musicians during a visit to  Tunis<em></em>are recorded in the
						film <em>Noon in Tunisia</em> (1969). Instruments  associated with this
						musical form, a type of bagpipe and a drum, feature in the  sculptures
						<strong>Crouching Venus with tabla</strong> and
						<strong>
							Mezoued and hands
						</strong>
						(both from  2024).
					</p>
					<p>
						In a film directed by  Jean-Denis Bonan, <em>Carthage Édouard  Glissant</em>
						(2006) that is presented within the exhibition, Glissant states  that he
						hopes the world may see a meeting between the spiritual powers of
						polytheistic philosophies and the spiritual powers of monotheistic
						philosophies, so as to overcome its antinomies and devastating conflicts.
						When  Glissant first set foot on Carthaginian soil, he had asked what other
						histories  might have unfolded if this great multicultural centre had not
						been destroyed —  if Rome has not rolled out its project to crush African
						resistance and dominate  the Mediterranean, what other lights might have
						been born and thrived on the  earth. We could also ask together with Nidhal
						Chamekh: what other lives might  have unfolded for the <em>exilés</em> of
						whom  Glissant’s fellow traveller Patrick Chamoiseu speaks in
						<em>
							Frères migrants
						</em>
						. In the exhibition, Chamekh's speculative  constellations activate the
						potential of these other lights, pointing to their  parallel existence and
						the insights they offer into the world’s multiple pasts,  presents and
						futures.
