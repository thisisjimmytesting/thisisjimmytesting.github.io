					24.06 — 26.09.2022
					<br> <br>
					The exhibition <i>Beauty and Terror: sites of colonialism and fascism</i> at the Madre museum of contemporary art in 2022 and the subsequent publication of the same title took the city of Naples and the Italian context in the years around 1940 as points of departure in order to investigate, through the eyes of contemporary artists and critical thinkers, the history and continuing legacy of the interconnections between colonialism and fascism in Italy. Another related event took place in 2023 at the Mucem in Marseille,

						Benito Mussolini considered that architecture, art and  exhibitions could
						provide privileged means for involving the broadest of  audiences in his
						regime’s ideological programme. Naples was the city that he  chose in order
						to lay out his vision of the predestination to Empire of Italian  Fascism by
						way of the extensive architectures, exhibits and parklands of the
						<em>
							Prima  Mostra Triennale delle Terre Italiane
						</em>
						<em>d'Oltremare</em> (First Triennial  Exhibition of the Italian Overseas
						Territories), which opened its gates in  Naples on 9 May 1940 — before
						closing a month later when Italy entered World War  II. This book and the
						exhibition <em>Beauty and Terror: sites of colonialism and  fascism</em> take
						the city of Naples and the Italian context in the years  around 1940 as
						points of departure in order to investigate, through the eyes of
						contemporary artists and critical thinkers, the history and continuing
						legacy  of the interconnections between colonialism and fascism in Italy.
						Juxtaposing stories rarely  told together, the project presents artistic
						research and critical perspectives  that draw links between the violence,
						both physical and psychological, of  colonialism and that of fascism, and
						explore the ideological, aesthetic and  iconographic apparatuses that
						subtend both. Fascist and colonial imagery,  monuments and architectures are
						still widespread in Italian visual culture and  urban
						landscapes<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>, yet a pervasive
						amnesia and denial limits public  debate outside of specialized and activist
						circles. It is interesting to ask  also how the display devices of universal
						and colonial exhibitions — as  showcases for art, culture and technology
						from across broad geographies, often  presented within spectacular
						architectural spaces and aiming to reach and  educate the broadest of
						publics — underpin certain dimensions of the scopic  regimes of art museums
						today. <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>

						The choice of Naples as the location for the
						<em>
							Prima  Mostra Triennale delle Terre Italiane d'Oltremare
						</em>
						, conceived following the  1935-1936 invasion of Ethiopia and Mussolini’s
						proclamation of empire,  reflected a desire to emphasise the 'imperial'
						nature of this Mediterranean  port that had linked the Italian peninsula
						with Africa and the east since  classical times, thus presenting Italian
						colonial expansion as already  inscribed in world history by the Roman
						Empire and its conquests in the  Mediterranean.
						<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">
							[iii]
						</a>
						The sculptural work <em>Al lettore benevolo</em> (To the benevolent reader,
						2022)  by Justin Randolph Thompson comments on long histories of the
						glorification of  conquest. He links Italian Fascist triumphalism also to
						Adolf Hitler’s visit to  Naples in 1938, referencing in the scaffolding that
						forms the base of his work  a spectacular triumphal arch featuring a host of
						trumpeters that was conceived  by the Neapolitan photographer and designer
						Giulio Parisio as the apogee of  Hitler’s tour through the city. Thompson’s
						work also includes a film and an antique-styled  mirror that both speak to
						fascism’s desire to claim classical antecedents for  its ambitions.  In the
						introductory  booklet published for the <em>Mostra</em>, entitled
						<em>
							Documentario
						</em>
						, its  overall aim was described as being to represent in the most
						interesting and  comprehensive manner 'the results that, through the work of
						civilisation across  the millennia, have crowned the efforts made by Italian
						genius, valour and  labour in the lands beyond the seas' and to illustrate
						'the historical,  geographical and economic aspects of our possessions, as
						well as the complex of  political, social and cultural activities that
						Fascist Italy assiduously  carries out for the totalitarian strengthening of
						its empire'. <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a> It was
						situated in the area of the Campi Flegrei which features archaeological
						sites  from Roman antiquity. The affirmation of the Roman presence through
						interpretations of archaeological traces, underlining its extent and the
						pervasiveness of its influence, contributed to justifying the Italian
						colonial  presence and methods in the territories they occupied, positioning
						the  colonisers as heirs to the Romans, legitimately unfolding their
						predestination  to empire and claiming their rights around the shores of
						<em>Mare Nostrum</em>, a  message that is also delivered resoundingly in
						<em>Scipione l'Africano</em> (1937), Carmine Gallone’s film of the Fascist
						period. The supreme ambition of  the exhibition overall was to present 'the
						historical and ideal continuity of  the imperial idea of Rome, from Caesar
						to Mussolini'. <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a> Mussolini
						had proclaimed the foundation of the Italian Empire on 9 May 1936,  shortly
						following the occupation of Addis Ababa — four years to the day before  the
						date he chose to open the
						<em>
							Prima Mostra Triennale delle Terre Italiane  d'Oltremare
						</em>
						. Importantly, his focus on the Roman Empire served also as a  reminder that
						the notion of civilization used historically by European imperial  powers to
						justify their colonial occupation through the so-called 'civilizing
						mission' is rooted in Roman antiquity and the Italian peninsula.

						The political inheritance of colonialism and fascism  in Italy is now being
						reframed on the one hand by the dramatic return in recent  years of populist
						ultranationalism in Europe as well as in the Americas, and, on  the other,
						by the far-reaching impact of the Black Lives Matter movement — together
						with the waves of contestation across broad geographies in relation to
						monuments in public space — drawing attention to forms of systematic
						exclusion  and violence linked to white supremacy and patriarchy that have
						their roots in  colonial occupation and slavery. In the essays commissioned
						for the second  section of this volume, different critical perspectives are
						brought to bear on this  contemporary nexus in Italy in relation to the
						European context. Political philosopher Elsa Dorlin points to the
						continuities between colonialism, fascism and neo-liberal governance,
						notably  in the normalisation of the use of violence towards civilian
						populations. Elsewhere,  she has coined the term 'necroliberalism' to
						describe the generalisation of  violence linked to the extraction of profit.
						<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a> She  underlines here the
						importance of protest and civil disobedience in situations  of state
						violence and structural injustice, noting, in the case of contemporary
						France, that demonstration and other means of expressing dissent are
						increasingly being criminalised. Social science researcher and activist
						Mackda  Ghebremariam Tesfau’ and artist Justin Randolph Thompson – who is
						also the  co-founder of Black History Month Florence and The Recovery Plan
						<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a> – address  forms of
						structural violence perpetrated by institutions of the state, and
						historical blindness in relation to movements of people across the
						Mediterranean towards the centres of imperial power that have rendered their
						homelands unliveable. They speak to the defence mechanisms deployed to
						protect interests  vested in the existing order of things, such as the
						appeal to universal, 'consensual',  values and to 'necessary measures' for
						ensuring security. Art historian Alessandro  Galicchio analyses Italian
						amnesia in the face of histories of colonial  violence in the eastern
						Mediterranean, with reference particularly to Albania  and its pavilion at
						the Mostra d'Oltremare (the current, shortened appellation  for the
						remaining parts of the exhibition grounds that Mussolini created, which  are
						today administered as spaces for commercial exhibitions and leisure). He
						unpacks  the racial thinking underlying the insistence on Roman
						archaeological heritage  in Albania to 'Italianise' the white population, so
						that their lands could be  labelled Italian 'possessions' (in distinction to
						the 'colonies' in Africa  where black people live).
					</p>
					<p>
						Many critical thinkers have traced connections between  the extreme violence
						of colonialism and that of fascism.  In his landmark text
						<em>
							Discourse on colonialism
						</em>
						(1950), poet and essayist Aimé Césaire points to the manner in which
						National  Socialism applied in Europe a scope of violence that had
						previously been  reserved for the colonies, an analysis that political
						philosopher Hannah Arendt  expands in her
						<em>
							Origins of Totalitarianism
						</em>
						(1951). <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[viii]</a> In  effect, the
						Second World War translated to the framework of European fascism  the
						extreme violence with impunity practised on slave plantations and in the
						colonies, as underlined by contemporary political philosopher Achille Mbembe
						in  his influential essay 'Necropolitics' (2003), arguing that 'in modern
						philosophical thought and European political practice and imaginary, the
						colony  represents the site where sovereignty consists fundamentally in the
						exercise of  a power outside the law' and 'where the violence of the state
						of exception is  deemed to operate in the service of ‘civilisation'.
						<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">
							[ix]
						</a>
						Life, land  and resources can be freely taken, as the humanity and
						sovereignty of the  inhabitants of colonised territories are not politically
						or legally recognised. <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[x]</a>
						Other  important thinkers on European imperialism, such as Franz Fanon and
						Sylvia  Wynter, have for this reason insisted not only on the physical but
						also of the  psychological dimensions of colonialism.
						<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">
							[xi]
						</a>
						Strong  parallels can be drawn today with the treatment of 'economic
						migrants', exiles  from previously colonised areas, and their experiences of
						detention and  exploitation. Artist Binta Diaw points to this correlation in
						her installation <em>Nero</em> <em>Sangue</em>(2020-2022) which juxtaposes a
						pile of black-painted tomatoes  with suspended, semi-transparent cotton
						banners onto which she has faintly  transferred the faces of black  men and
						women from photographs that appeared in the magazines
						<em>
							La difesa  della razza
						</em>
						(The defence of the race) and <em>Tempo</em>,  both subsidised by the
						Fascist regime. Racial laws were introduced in Italy in 1938  and the Race
						Manifesto of that year announced the existence of a pure 'Italian  race'.
						Diaw reworks the original images  through her delicate, hand-made transfers,
						a process of withdrawing these people  from the dehumanising context in
						which they had been represented; she then  turns the viewer’s attention
						towards the continuities that can be found in the  contemptuous and often
						violent treatment suffered by black people, many of them  exiles without
						legal documents, who slave under the hot sun in the tomato fields  of
						southern Italy. The work references  the justifications for colonial
						expropriation laid out through the invention of  'racial sciences' in
						Europe, running in parallel to the affirmation of a  genealogy traced to
						Greek and Roman antiquity in the development of European  Humanism —which
						cloaks under its ideology of universalism the reality of the  exclusion of
						most of humanity from its protections and rights. Departing from
						little-discussed events, architectures, archival materials, stories and
						situations, Diaw and other artists in <em>Beauty and Terror</em> address in
						varying ways the imposition of regimes of economic and political control
						over  the south by the north from the period of Italian fascism and
						colonialism to  the present, as well as how scientific and aesthetic
						apparatuses are pressed  into service to reinforce and justify these regimes
						of control.

						In her work <em>L’Incoronazione della Vergine tra  angeli e santi</em>
						(Coronation of the Virgin amidst angels and saints, 2022),  Giulia
						Piscitelli creates an overlay on maps of Italian East Africa published  by
						the Consociazione Turistica Italiana (Italian Tourism Association) in 1938
						under the Fascist colonial Empire, producing a cartography of gold leaf
						halos,  calling to mind the long history of Christianity in the Horn of
						Africa, dating  back to the fourth century AD in the Kingdom of Axum. Beyond
						their religious,  auratic associations, the gold halos also evoke military
						targets and the  extraction of wealth during the period of Italian imperial
						domination<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[xii]</a>; in  her
						related group of paintings <em>Terra, sistema</em> <em>periodico</em>
						<em>
							#1-#6
						</em>
						(Earth, periodic table #1-#6, 2022), Piscitelli uses pigments containing
						minerals present in Eritrean and Ethiopian soil.
						<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">
							[xiii]
						</a>
						Theo  Eshetu’s video installation <em>The return of the Axum obelisk</em>
						(2009)  visually recounts the story of the return of a historical stele to
						Axum in  Ethiopia that had been stolen by representatives of the Italian
						Fascist  government and shipped in pieces, arriving in Naples in 1937 before
						being  reassembled and erected in Porta Capena Square in Rome in front of
						the Ministry  of the Colonies. Ethiopian demands for restitution of the
						stele continued for  over half a century before this important piece of
						cultural heritage was finally  returned in 2005 and then reinstalled in Axum
						in 2008 after restoration. Nidhal  Chamekh’s large drawing installed on
						scaffolding, <em>Et si Carthage? #1</em> (2023), brings together fragments
						of images and text relating the story of the  stele of Axum alongside
						another object stolen by Italian invading forces that  had arrived in Naples
						together with it in 1937, a monument to the Lion of Judah  (symbolizing the
						Ethiopian Emperors) that was put on display outside Termini  Station in
						Rome. The monument returned to Ethiopia in response to petitions for
						restitution and re-installed by Emperor Haile Selassie in 1971 — in its
						original location outside the France-Ethiopian Railway Company building in
						Addis Ababa. Faced with the long history of the looting of obelisks and
						other  sculptures from North Africa for the glorification of European
						colonial regimes  and the naturalisation of their imperial power, Chamekh
						seeks to translate, in  his assemblages of heterogeneous elements, the
						dissonances, discontinuities and  hybridisations that they contain.
						<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">

						He is  interested in how images, whether historical or current, are not
						static, but  are rather constantly redefining and redeploying themselves
						across visual  culture, literature, the natural and human sciences and other
						fields. While generally  this redeployment acts to underpin and reinforce
						existing historical and  political tropes, there is also a potential for
						this montage process to  contribute to rethinking and reactivating otherwise
						the past in the present.
					</p>
					<p>
						Returning to the
						<em>
							Prima Mostra Triennale delle Terre  Italiane d'Oltremare
						</em>
						, the selection of Naples, and of the specific site in  the working-class
						area of Fuorigrotta, also had another motivation, that of  kick-starting a
						social, urban and economic renewal of the city to offer 'the  best solution
						to the complex Neapolitan problem'.
						<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">
							[xv]
						</a>
						The <em>Documentario</em> brochure proclaims that the <em>Mostra</em>'is not
						a museum of dead things or a  mercantile exhibition or a colossal fair: it
						is rather the greatest work that  imperial Naples offers to Italy and to
						itself'. <a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[xvi]</a> Covering an
						area of around a square kilometre, the architect-designed complex  featured
						36 pavilions, offices, an open-air arena that could accommodate more  than
						10,000 people, two theatres, an Olympic swimming pool, a zoo and a  tropical
						aquarium. It was intended to be a motor for economic development and a
						vector of social transformation in this capital of the south that had
						spiralled  down from its past status as a cosmopolitan centre of learning,
						commerce and  the arts due to high unemployment rates and deeply rooted
						organised crime,  raising the spectre of the 'southern question' that
						emerged after Italian  unification of how to address economic
						'backwardness', poverty and criminality  in the south of the country. The
						inhabitants of southern Italy were sometimes  referred to as Africans by
						their northern counterparts, mobilizing an imaginary  of the 'uncivilised'
						or 'primitive' with a long history; from the second half  of the sixteenth
						century, Jesuits returning from South America to carry out  missionary
						activities in the Kingdom of Naples had referred to the south as the
						'Italian Indes' and to southerners as 'the Indians from around here'.
						<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">
							[xvii]
						</a>
						Mussolini  was intent on smoothing the divide between north and south; the
						notion of 'one  Italy' had formed part of nationalist Fascist rhetoric since
						the 1920s. Another  benefit of empire, from Mussolini’s perspective, was to
						consolidate a unified  Italian identity. By the 1930s, he declared that the
						'southern question' was  solved, as Ethiopians rather than southerners were
						threatening the Italian  nation and its imperial greatness through their
						continuing guerrilla  resistance.
						<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">
							[xviii]
						</a>
						The Fascist regime manifestly racialised and dehumanised Ethiopians to
						justify  their colonial aspirations and military offensive. Interestingly,
						they also  tried to use religious differences within Ethiopia to divide the
						resistance,  with Mussolini promising that he, unlike Haile Selassie’s
						Orthodox Christian  regime, would protect and provide space for Muslims in
						the colonial territory  and proclaiming in 1937 that Italy 'will always be
						the friend and protector of  Islam'.
						<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">
							[xix]
						</a>
						Ethiopian resistance  fighters continued to wage war on the ground
						throughout the Italian reign of  terror – which included widespread sexual
						slavery and violence to women.
						<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">
							[xx]
						</a>
						Rossella Biscotti’s <em>Note su Zeret</em> (Notes on Zeret, 2014-2015)
						records  through photographs and risograph prints the artist’s visit to the
						site of a  massacre carried out by the Italian army between 9 and 11 April
						1939 in which around  2000 people living in the Zeret cave in the Manz
						region north of Addis Ababa  were killed. The large cave complex, in which
						members of the resistance had  taken refuge, was home to women, men and
						children and featured granaries,  cooking areas, storage jars and baskets
						for winnowing. <a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[xxi]</a> The
						Italian army threw bombs filled with mustard gas into the cave and then
						executed by machine gun those who surrendered or tried to escape the gas,
						with  just a handful of people surviving.
						<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">
							[xxii]
						</a>
						It was only in 2006 that information on the massacre was published for the
						first time in Italy by historian Matteo Dominioni and this history is still
						not  widely known or discussed. <a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">
						[xxiii]</a> Biscotti was taken to the cave by descendants of survivors and
						other local  community members who expressed their wish that the story of
						the massacre be more  widely told. Later research initiated by the artist
						suggests that the mustard  gas used may have been shipped from the military
						base in Naples.
					</p>
					<p>
						The massacre at Zeret  took place a year and a month before the opening of
						Mussolini’s great colonial  exhibition that was designed to show the
						results of 'Italian genius, valour and labour in the lands beyond the seas'
						on  9 May 1940. Within the
						<em>
							Prima Mostra Triennale delle Terre Italiane  d'Oltremare
						</em>
						, the pavilion for Africa Orientale Italiana included sections  for each of
						the six administrative areas of the empire — Amara, Eritrea, Harar, Galla e
						Sidamo, Scioa e  Somalia — each divided into three  sections: the
						physical/natural environment, ethnicity and history, and  colonisation.
						<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">
							[xxiv]
						</a>
						A special entrance hall had been constructed called the <em>Cubo d’Oro</em>,
						or  Golden Cube, of which the outside mosaic relief decoration took
						inspiration  from the architectures of Axum. Inside, the
						<em>
							Salone dell’Impero
						</em>
						, the  Empire Salon, featured two enormous frescoes by Giovanni Brancaccio
						facing each  other across the space in the centre of which was a mosaic
						globe showing the  spread of Italians around the world. The frescoes, which
						still exist in a  degraded state, feature Julius Caesar on one side and
						Mussolini on the other,  each seated on a horse with their armies massed
						around them. <a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[xxv]</a> The
						nearby area outside was designated for the 'indigenous villages' and other
						buildings in the vernacular architectural styles of the colonial
						territories,  including a Coptic church and a mosque, as described in this
						review:
					</p>
					<p>
						Alongside the Mostra d’A.O.I [pavilion of  Italian East Africa] stands the
						area of the indigenous villages, which presents  to the public a
						reconstruction of the most typical forms of habitation in the  territories
						of the Empire: among the tamarinds, ferns, junipers and acacias,  the tents
						of the nomads rise up; dwellings of the tukul ambara and hudmò of the  high
						planes follow; the beehive-huts of the sedentary Cunama, built of dung and
						clay, almost touch the light tents of the Danakili; a few Galla huts, a
						typical  Sidamo habitation, a group of circular Somali constructions and the
						small  mosque complete the picture of ethnic diversity, over which the
						substantial  ghebi of the Amhara chief and the characteristic architecture
						of the Coptic  church dominate. <a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">
						[xxvi]</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						In the landscape of diversity that had been assembled,  the apogee was
						formed by a recreation of Emperor Fasilides baths in Gondar, the  capital he
						founded in the 1630s (Fasilides is the Amhara chief to whom the  review
						refers). The stone edifice and the lake into which it dips its feet evoke
						the Grand Tour taste for the ruins of earlier civilisations overrun by
						nature.  Here also are the vignettes of the local inhabitants who live
						alongside the  ruins of past grandeur, but can never be the subjects of the
						grand historical narratives  that the stones record — and whose land thus
						passes naturally into the hands of  an imperial power destined to write
						History. Fifty-eight people — 17 women, 7  children and the rest men,
						including Orthodox and other Christians as well as  Muslims — were
						transported from Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritrea to represent different  areas
						of the empire and figure  in the landscape as living exhibits in a human zoo
						within the 'indigenous  villages'.
						<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">
							[xxvii]
						</a>
						Photoreporter Federico Patellani took numerous photographs of them during
						the  exhibition for the magazine <em>Tempo</em>. When Italy entered World
						War II and  the exhibition closed, they were unable to return home and would
						remain confined  for years in the spaces of the Mostra d'Oltremare suffering
						from hunger and  cold, as well as the terror of allied bombings. Some of
						them were employed in  film on a number of occasions, the strangest perhaps
						being in November 1942 when  they were all escorted by police to lodgings in
						Frascati near Rome for a month,  at the request of Cines production company
						working at the Cinecittà studios, in  order to appear in the propaganda film
						<em>Harlem</em> directed by Carmine  Gallone, the plot of which centres on
						an Italian-American boxer who beats his  Abyssinian opponent in 1930s New
						York. <a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[xxviii]</a> In  April
						1942, the group was finally transferred to a former women's internment  camp
						in Treia, from which the Jewish, British, French and Yugoslavian prisoners
						had been evacuated due to the camp's poor hygienic conditions. In another
						twist, some are known to have escaped to join an international band of
						anti-fascist partisans.
						<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">
							[xxix]
						</a>
						It  was not until after the war, in the period from late 1945 to mid-1946,
						that  most of the Eritreans, Somalians and Ethiopians were able to return
						home. <a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[xxx]</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						In relation to this story and in particular to the  photographs of
						Patellani, curator Sarah  Bushra and dancer/choreographer Dawit Seeto
						conceived a response to the  violence captured in and enacted by the
						photographs, a performance and spoken  word piece entitled <em>ከገፅታው</em><em></em><em>በስተጀርባ</em><em>; 
						Look Here</em>. Working with  embodied gestures that draw on the language of
						traditional dances in Ethiopia,  using the 'Movement Vocab methodology' they
						developed together in past work,  they chose five photographs to explore how
						gestures may provide an entry point  for the encounter with the palpable
						violence that the photographs record and perpetrate.  Artist Délio Jasse
						similarly considers the violence of photographic images in  the colonial
						context, particularly focussing on analysing European colonists’
						self-representation, notably in family photographs and other vernacular
						images.  For his workshop activating the <em>Beauty and Terror</em>
						exhibition space in  Naples, he and the participants worked with images from
						different sources,  including reportage shots taken by Neapolitan
						photographer and filmmaker  Roberto Troncone of farming families from the
						south of Italy waiting on the  port to embark for Libya. He turned his lens
						on these modest people to document  their departure for the promised new
						life in the colonies: a woman breastfeeding  her baby, others struggling to
						carry chickens with them in baskets, families all  dressed in their best
						clothes. <a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[xxxi]</a> In their
						major  project
						<em>
							Ente di Decolonizzazione - Borgo
							<s>
								Rizza
							</s>
						</em>
						(2022 - ongoing),  DAAR – the platform created by Sandi Hilal and Alessandro
						Petti that is  situated between architecture, art, pedagogy and politics –
						investigates the violent  architectures of the internal colonisation of
						Sicily by the fascist regime,  which in 1940 created the  the 'Entity of
						Colonization of the Sicilian Latifundium', on the basis of a similar
						'Entity'  in Libya. Eight new small rural townships were created in
						different areas of Sicily  that were considered empty and underdeveloped,
						each featuring the key buildings  necessary for the new model settlements in
						stark, rationalist architecture.  DAAR scaled down elements of the
						architecture of one of these rural towns  created to kick-start agricultural
						production, Borgo Rizza, to human sized  modules. The mobile modules are
						exhibited but also activated to create spaces  for discussion and debate,
						particularly in relation to how the violent heritage  of fascism and
						colonialism may be digested and transformed to generate new  possibilities
						and vocabularies. The first activation was held outdoors at the  Mostra
						d’Oltremare in early May 2022, exactly 82 years after Mussolini opened  in
						these same spaces his grand orchestration of an experiential device for
						awakening the Italian  masses to their predestined imperial privilege.

						Today fascist dynamics are moving to the core of  political life over wide
						geographies. In
						<em>
							Late Fascism: Race, capitalism and  the politics of crisis
						</em>
						(2023), critical social theorist Alberto Toscano  points to how today's
						global far-right is stirring up panic about threats to longstanding
						geopolitical, gendered and racial regimes.
						<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">
							[xxxii]
						</a>
						Art  historian and political theorist, Mikkel Bolt Rasmussen notes in his
						<em>Late  Capitalist Fascism</em> (2021)  that contemporary fascism is more
						to do with the violence of bordering Europe  and the United States and much
						less to do with ambitious infrastructure  projects, experiments in new
						social forms and territorial expansionism than  fascism last century. It
						looks less to the future and is widely characterised  by a flattening or
						emptying out of politics and by the valorisation of ties to  land, aspiring
						to build an imagined organic community through the exclusion of  foreigners
						and non-white people, or their consignment without political and juridical
						rights to zones of control and violence.
						<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">

						Under the current Italian government of Prime  Minister Georgia Meloni and
						her party Fratelli D'Italia, the political focus on  border control has
						increased exponentially. Since taking office in 2022, Georgia  Meloni has
						travelled repeatedly to neighbouring countries around the  Mediterranean,
						including Tunisia, Libya and Albania, specifically to discuss Italy’s
						financial support of reinforced regimes of control of would-be migrants
						outside  of Europe’s borders. At the time of her party's electoral victory,
						she  announced her desire to put up a 'naval blockade' to stop arrivals by
						sea; in  reality this work has been outsourced to other governments who have
						received  Italian and European funding to detain would be migrants in camps
						and deport  them. In the case of Kais Saied's regime in Tunisia, it has been
						documented  this has in fact frequently involved transporting black people
						to desert areas  and abandoning them.
						<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">

						</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Alongside these political and economic orientations, the lessons of
						Mussolini’s regime in regards to the potential to promulgate government
						policy  laterally through broad-public exhibitions have not been lost on the
						current  government. In 2023, the Galleria Nazionale in Rome paid tribute to
						one of Georgia  Meloni’s favourite authors, J.R.R Tolkien, with an
						exhibition, conceived (and supported to the tune of €250,000)  by the
						Ministry of Culture, <em>Tolkien: Uomo, Professore, Autore</em>, timed to
						take place fifty years after the Italian publication of <em>The Hobbit</em>.
						<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title="">[xxxv]</a> A review of the
						exhibition notes that the youth wing of Italy’s post-fascist  movement
						‘quite  consciously adopted the language and symbolism of Tolkien’s world to
						replace  its own disgraced ideological aesthetic: swastikas were out, and
						Celtic crosses  were in’.
						<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title="">
							[xxxvi]
						</a>
						Tolkien-themed youth festivals called Camp Hobbit were held from the late
						1970s<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[xxxvii]</a>, and, as a
						member of the post-fascist  Italian Social Movement (MSI, one of the
						organisers of <em>Campo Hobbit</em>), Meloni  herself also dressed up as a
						hobbit to deliver talks to schoolchildren. Tolkein’s  elves, wizards,
						dwarves and hobbits hold a deep fascination for the far right  in Italy as
						expressions of 'indigenous' connections to land, fighting to save  their
						magical forests, their mountain halls filled with gold, their picturesque
						Shire, their culture and  traditions, from the massed minions of the Dark
						Lord. With the exhibition at  the Galleria Nazionale, this story is
						circulated to the show’s large audiences  as a parable for our times.
