					An  exhibition, book and series of programmes focussing on contemporary
					artistic  research-based practices and critical thinking that are
					contributing to  cultural and political processes centring on political
					ecology in different  contexts in order to rethink and transform conceptions
					of nature bequeathed by  Europe’s Enlightenment paradigms in parallel to its
					imperial expansion.

						<em>Rethinking Nature</em> brings together artistic research  and critical
						thinking responding to issues related to political ecology in different
						contexts in order to transform conceptions of nature bequeathed by Europe’s
						Enlightenment paradigms in parallel to its imperial expansion. The project
						involves artists, theorists and activists with heterogeneous profiles and
						practices, coming from different geographical areas, invited to develop
						dialogues between critical speculation and artistic experimentation. In
						continuity with the Cosmopolis platform conceived by Kathryn Weir, the
						project's methodology focuses on contemporary interdisciplinary practices
						based  on research and collaboration. Through this book, building on an
						exhibition at  the Madre museum and a series of events, workshops, meetings,
						as well as  commissions of new works, <em>Rethinking  Nature</em> is an
						ongoing process acting to reconceptualise relationships  between the human
						and the more than human.

					<p>
						The acceleration of global warming, the rising of the seas, mass
						extinctions of species, widespread weather anomalies, flows and seepages of
						toxicity impossible to contain: these unfolding predicaments cannot be
						separated from the modern European paradigm that conceives of nature –
						including much of humanity – as a reserve of resources to be freely
						exploited  for profit. Such economics of extraction have a long history that
						is in-  tertwined with the history of European imperialism and colonialism.
						The  consequences have been devastating: the suppression of Indigenous and
						other  non-capitalist cultures and knowledge systems, and the vast
						environmental  desolation caused by the pursuit of limitless growth. Today,
						the destructive  effects of capitalism’s unwavering focus on profit and
						growth are more widely  recognised, as the impunity with which it has de-
						stroyed worlds and spread  toxicity and pollution in its wake is resulting
						in the collapse of ecosystems  and escalating climatic disruption.
					</p>
					<p>
						Contemporary artistic research-based practices are contributing  in
						different contexts to cultural and political processes centring on ecology
						that may help to rethink conceptions of nature and transform the paradigms
						bequeathed by Europe’s Enlightenment sciences in parallel to its imperial
						expansion.
